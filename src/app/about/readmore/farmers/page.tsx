            <li>
              <strong>Create a Farmer Profile:</strong> Youâ€™ll be onboarded by a local
              FarmCred representative or partner cooperative.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>List Produce:</strong> Share available stock, quantity, location, and
              delivery options. Add photos if available.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Chat With Buyers:</strong> Answer questions from interested buyers through
              in-app messaging.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deliver the Produce:</strong> Once an order is confirmed, arrange pickup
              or delivery as agreed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Receive Payment:</strong> FarmCred holds payment securely until the
              buyer confirms receipt. Then youâ€™re paid instantly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Build Reputation:</strong> Good reviews improve visibility and open up
              investment or loan options.
